Dispute Resolution: In the event that there is a dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Us, or between you
    and Stodge, LLC d/b/a Postscript or any other third-party service provider acting on Our behalf to
    transmit the mobile messages within the scope of the Program, arising out of or relating to federal or state
    statutory claims, common law claims, this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or
    validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, such
    dispute, claim, or controversy will be, to the fullest extent permitted by law, determined by arbitration
    in La Jolla, California before one arbitrator.
</p> <p>
The parties agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules
    of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) then in effect. Except as otherwise provided
    herein, the arbitrator shall apply the substantive laws of the Federal Judicial Circuit in which
Sun Coast Sciences&rsquo; principal place of business is located, without regard to its conflict of laws rules.
    Within ten
    (10) calendar days after the arbitration demand is served upon a party, the parties must jointly select an
    arbitrator with at least five years&rsquo; experience in that capacity and who has knowledge of and experience
    with the subject matter of the dispute. If the parties do not agree on an arbitrator within ten (10) calendar days,
    a party may petition the AAA to appoint an arbitrator, who must satisfy the same experience requirement.
    In the event of a dispute, the arbitrator shall decide the enforceability and interpretation of this arbitration
    agreement in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (&ldquo;FAA&rdquo;). The parties also agree that
    the AAA&rsquo;s rules governing Emergency Measures of Protection shall apply in lieu of seeking emergency injunctive
    relief from a court. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding, and no party shall have
    rights of appeal except for those provided in section 10 of the FAA. Each party shall bear its share of the fees
    paid for the arbitrator and the administration of the arbitration; however, the arbitrator shall have the
    power to order one party to pay all or any portion of such fees as part of a well-reasoned decision. The parties
    agree that the arbitrator shall have the authority to award attorneys&rsquo; fees only to the extent
    expressly authorized by statute or contract. The arbitrator shall have no authority to award punitive damages and
    each party hereby waives any right to seek or recover punitive damages with respect to any dispute
    resolved by arbitration. The parties agree to arbitrate solely on an individual basis, and this agreement does not
    permit class arbitration or any claims brought as a plaintiff or class member in any class or
    representative arbitration proceeding. Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor the arbitrator may
    disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration without the prior written consent of both
    parties, unless to protect or pursue a legal right. If any term or provision of this Section is invalid, illegal, or
    unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect
    any other term or provision of this Section or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any
    other jurisdiction. If for any reason a dispute proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the parties
    hereby waive any right to a jury trial. This arbitration provision shall survive any cancellation or termination of
    your agreement to participate in any of our Programs.
</p> <p>

    party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein will not be deemed a waiver of any
    further rights hereunder. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision
    will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise
    remain in full force and effect and enforceable. Any new features, changes, updates, or improvements of the Program
