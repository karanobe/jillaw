        as spam. These efforts may, on occasion, result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of
        some functions for some users. By using our Site, you acknowledge and agree that we may access, retain and
        disclose the personal data we collect and maintain about you if required to do so by law or in a good faith
        belief that such access, retention, or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process

</li> <li aria-level="1"> <strong><em>To assist in Business Transfers</em></strong>. As we continue to develop our business, we may
        buy, merge, or partner with other companies. In such transactions, (including in contemplation of such
        transactions) user information may be among the transferred assets. If a portion or all of Company&rsquo;s
        assets are sold or transferred to a third-party, customer personal data (including your email address) would
        likely be one of the transferred business assets. If such transfer is subject to additional mandatory
        restrictions under applicable laws, we will comply with such restrictions.

This Site does not collect personal data when you browse the Site and request pages from our
    servers<em>unless</em> you voluntarily and knowingly provide such information to us. This means that we will not
    know your
    name, your email address, or any other personal data just because you browse the Site unless you:
</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">access the Site from a link in an email that we have sent to you;</li> <li aria-level="1">have created a profile and you either log-in to your account or choose to be remembered via
        your cookie or your web-enabled mobile device.</li> </ul> <p>

    request a page from our Site, our servers log the information provided in the HTTP request header including the
    IP
    number, the time of the request, the URL of your request and other information that is provided in the HTTP
    header. We collect the HTTP request header information to make our Site functions correctly and provides you
    with the functionality that you expect to see. We also use this information to personalize content presented to
    you, better understand how visitors use our Site and how we can better tune it, its contents, and
    functionality to meet your needs. We only use your personally identifiable information for those activities
    listed at the time you submit your information to us. For example, if you provide us with an email to inform you
    of special events, then that is what we will use your email address to do. If we would like to use your
    personally identifiable information for an unrelated activity, we will first request your consent to do so.
</p> <br> <p><strong>HOW DO WE PROTECT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p> <strong><em>Security of Personal Data</em></strong> </p> <p>
We are committed to protecting the security of your personal data. Depending on the circumstances, we may hold
    your information in hard copy and/or electronic form. For each medium, we use technologies and procedures to
    protect personal data. We review our strategies and update as necessary to meet our business needs, changes in
    technology, and regulatory requirements. We take our security obligations seriously and so should you. While
    we are responsible for maintaining the security of this Site, you must also access and use this Site in a manner
    that is responsible and secure. In addition, we have implemented a series of policies, procedures, and
    training to address data protection, confidentiality, and security, and we update and review the appropriateness
    of these measures on a regular basis.

    take steps to ensure that the data we collect under this Privacy Policy is processed pursuant to the terms
    thereof and the requirements of applicable law wherever the data is located.
</p> <p>
We also collaborate with third parties such as cloud hosting services and suppliers located around the world to
    serve the needs of our business, workforce, and customers. In some cases, we may need to disclose or
    transfer your personal data within the Company or to third parties in areas outside of your home country. When
    we do so, we take steps to ensure that personal data is processed, secured, and transferred according to
    applicable law.

We retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide the services and fulfill the transactions you have
    requested, or for other business purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes,
    and enforcing our agreements. We are required by law to keep some types of information for certain periods of
    time (e.g., statute of limitations). If your personal data is no longer necessary for the legal or business
    purposes for which it is processed, we will generally destroy or anonymize that information.

We respect your right to access and control your personal data. You have choices about the data we collect. When
    you are asked to provide personal data that is not necessary for the purposes of providing you with our
    Products and Services, you may decline. However, if you choose not to provide data that is necessary to provide
    a Service, you may not have access to certain features, Sites, Products, or Services.

    your personal data if it is inaccurate or requires updating. You may also have the right to request

    procedures.

While there is not yet a consensus, data practices of third-party cookies and tracking technologies associated
    with our websites and mobile app may constitute a &ldquo;Sale&rdquo; of your personal information as defined
    by the CCPA. You can exercise control over browser-based cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser, and
    mobile devices may offer ad limitation choices. In addition, third party tools may enable you to search for
    and opt-out of some of these trackers, such as the Ghostery browser plug-in available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ghostery.com/">www.ghostery.com</a>. You can learn more about your choices regarding
    certain kinds of
    online interest-based advertising in our privacy policy. We do not represent that these third-party tools,
    programs or statements are complete or accurate, clearing cookies or changing settings may affect your choices
    and you may have to opt-out separately via each browser and other device you use.
</p> <p>
Some browsers have signals that may be characterized as do not track signals, but we do not understand them to
    operate in that manner or to represent a &ldquo;do not sell&rdquo; request by you; accordingly, currently we
    do not view these signals as a do not sell request. We understand that various parties are developing do not
    sell signals and we may recognize certain such signals if we conclude such a program is appropriate.
</p> <p>We do sell the personal information of Consumers. All consumers, regardless of age, may opt out of our
    promotional emails by clicking the &lsquo;unsubscribe&rsquo; link on each of our brand emails.</p> <br> <p> <strong><em>4. The Right to Non-Discrimination</em></strong> </p> <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights, and will not engage in the following
    behaviors:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Denying you goods or services</li> <li aria-level="1">Charging you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting
        discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties</li> <li aria-level="1">Providing you a different level or quality of goods or services</li> <li aria-level="1">Suggesting that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a
        different level or quality of goods or services</li> </ul> <p>When you exercise these rights and submit a request to us, we will verify your identity by asking for information
    about your relationship with us, such as email address on file.</p> <p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require
    more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.</p> <p>
Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request&apos;s
    receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if
    applicable.
</p> <br> <p> <strong><em>Authorized Agents</em></strong> </p> <p>You may authorize a natural person or a business entity registered with the California Secretary of State to act
    on your behalf to make a request to know or to delete your personal information.</p> <p>
To do so, you must (i) verify your identity to us and provide that authorized agent written permission to make
    such a request or (ii) provide the authorized agent with power of attorney pursuant to the California Probate
    Code sections 4000 to 4465.
</p> <p>The authorized agent must include those authorizations in the verifiable consumer request.</p> <br> <p> <strong><em>Notice of Financial Incentive</em></strong><sup>2</sup> </p> <p>
We will not discriminate against you in a manner prohibited by the CCPA because you exercise your CCPA rights.
    However, we may charge a different price or rate, or offer a different level or quality of goods or services,
    to the extent that doing so is reasonably related to the value of the applicable data. In addition, we may offer
    you financial incentives for the collection, Sale, retention, and use of your personal information as
    permitted by the CCPA; such offers may result in reasonably different prices, rates, or quality levels. The
    material aspects of any financial incentive will be explained and described in its program terms. For details of
    our current financial incentive program and its terms, including how to opt-in or withdraw your opt-in, program
    benefits, refer to our Rewards Terms and Conditions.
</p> <p>
Please note that participating in incentive programs is entirely optional; participants affirmatively opt into
    the program, and can opt out of the program (i.e., terminate participation and forgo the ongoing incentives)
    by following the instructions in the program&rsquo;s description and terms. We may add or change incentive
    programs and/or their terms by posting a notice on the program descriptions and terms linked to above, so check
    them regularly.
</p> <p>
To opt out of the financial incentives, please review our Privacy Policy and use the contact information found
    in that policy to submit a request to us. If you opt out we will not reduce the value of any financial
    incentives you previously received from us.
</p> <p>
We do not assign a monetary value to the data that we collect and strive to only use that information to further
    our business in accordance with our Privacy Policy; to the extent that we are required to assign a monetary
    value to your personal information it is equal to the value of the discount or financial incentive that we have
    provided to you.
